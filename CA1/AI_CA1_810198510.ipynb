    "The code contains these functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"ids_path()\", \"dfs_path()\", \"bfs()\", \"a_star()\" and \"weighted_astar\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### $\\color{green}{\\text{ids_path():}}$\n",
    "The ids_path function implements the iterative deepening search algorithm. It starts by initializing a depth variable to 0. Then, it calls the dls_path function with the current depth and checks if the function returns a path or not. If a path is found, it returns the path. Otherwise, it increments the depth by 1 and calls the dls_path function again with the new depth. This process is repeated until a path is found or until the maximum depth is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dls_path function implements the depth-limited search algorithm. It takes in the graph, the current node, the goal node, the maximum depth, and a list of visited nodes. It first checks if the current node is the goal node or if the maximum depth has been reached. If either of these conditions is true, it returns the current node. Otherwise, it adds the current node to the visited nodes list and recursively calls itself on each of the current node's neighbors that have not been visited yet with the depth decremented by 1. If any of these recursive calls return a path, it returns the path that includes the current node. If no path is found, it returns None.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### $\\color{green}{\\text{dfs_path():}}$\n",
    "The dfs_path() function implements the Depth-First Search algorithm to find a path from a starting node to a goal node in a graph. The function takes four arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* graph: A dictionary that represents the graph in the form of adjacency lists, where each key is a string representation of a node and its value is a list of adjacent nodes.\n",
    "* start: The starting node as a string.\n",
    "* goal: The goal node as a string.\n",
    "* path: A list that keeps track of the current path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function first checks whether path is None. If it is, it initializes path as an empty list. The starting node is then appended to path. If the starting node is the same as the goal node, the function returns path because a path has been found. Otherwise, the function iterates over the list of adjacent nodes of the current node. If a neighbor has not been visited before, the function calls itself recursively with the neighbor as the new starting node, the same goal node, and the updated path. If the recursive call returns a path, the function returns that path. If no path is found, the current node is removed from the path. The function returns None if no path is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of how the function works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function first checks if the path argument is None. If it is, it initializes path as an empty list.\n",
    "2. The starting node start is added to the path list.\n",
    "3. If start is equal to goal, the function returns the current path list as the solution.\n",
    "4. If start is not equal to goal, the function recursively calls itself for each adjacent node of start that is not already in the path. The recursive call is made with the adjacent node as the new start, the original goal, and the current path. The resulting new_path is returned.\n",
    "5. If new_path is not None, it means that a path was found. The function returns new_path.\n",
    "6. If the function exhausts all possible adjacent nodes and new_path is still None, it backtracks by removing the last node from the path list.\n",
    "7. If no path is found, the function returns None.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $\\color{green}{\\text{bfs()}}$\n",
    "The bfs() function implements the Breadth-First Search algorithm to find a path from a starting node to a goal node in a graph. The function takes three arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* graph: A dictionary that represents the graph in the form of adjacency lists, where each key is a string representation of a node and its value is a list of adjacent nodes.\n",
    "* start: The starting node as a string.\n",
    "* goal: The goal node as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function first initializes a queue with the starting node. It also initializes a set of visited nodes and a dictionary that maps nodes to their parent nodes in the path. The function then enters a loop that continues until the queue is empty. In each iteration, the function removes the first node from the queue and adds it to the set of visited nodes. If the removed node is the goal node, the function builds the path from the starting node to the goal node and returns it. Otherwise, the function adds unvisited neighbors of the removed node to the queue, along with their parent nodes in the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of how the function works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize the queue with the starting node:\n",
    "This creates a new queue using the deque class from the collections module, and adds the starting node to the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Keep track of visited nodes:\n",
    "This creates a new empty set called visited, which we'll use to keep track of which nodes we've already visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Keep track of the path from start to current node:\n",
    "This creates a new dictionary called path, where the keys are nodes in the graph and the values are the nodes that led to those keys. We initialize the start key to None, since the starting node has no predecessor in the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Traverse the graph using BFS:\n",
    "This is the main loop of the BFS algorithm. As long as there are nodes in the queue, we'll continue traversing the graph. We get the next node from the queue using popleft(), add it to the visited set, and then start looking for its neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Check if we've found the goal node:\n",
    "Whenever we visit a node, we check if it's the goal node we're looking for. If it is, we've found a path from the starting node to the goal node. We use the path dictionary to trace back from the goal node to the starting node, and build a list of nodes in the path. We then reverse the list (since we built it backwards) and return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Add unvisited neighbors to the queue:\n",
    "For each unvisited neighbor of the current node, we add it to the queue and mark its predecessor in the path dictionary. We use str(current) to convert the current node from an integer to a string, since the keys in the graph dictionary are strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Return None if no path is found:\n",
    "If we've traversed the entire graph and haven't found a path to the goal node, we'll return None.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $\\color{green}{\\text{a_star()}}$\n",
    "This function implements the A* algorithm to find a path between start and goal nodes in a given graph. \n",
    "The A* algorithm is a popular pathfinding algorithm that combines the Dijkstra algorithm and heuristics to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. A* algorithm uses a heuristic function to estimate the distance between a node and the goal. This heuristic function is used to prioritize the search towards the goal node. This makes the A* algorithm more efficient than Dijkstra algorithm in finding the shortest path in a graph. The function returns a list representing the path from the start to the goal node if it is found; otherwise, it returns None.\n",
    "The function takes the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* graph: A dictionary representing the graph, where the keys are the nodes and the values are the lists of adjacent nodes.\n",
    "* start: The starting node to search from.\n",
    "* goal: The goal node to search for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of what the function does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function takes in a graph, a starting node, and a goal node as its inputs.\n",
    "2. A priority queue is initialized as the frontier for the algorithm. The start node is added to the queue with a priority of 0.\n",
    "3. Two dictionaries are initialized to keep track of the cost of reaching each node from the start node, and the node that came before each node in the optimal path. Both dictionaries are initialized with the start node.\n",
    "4. The algorithm enters a while loop which runs until the frontier queue is empty.\n",
    "5. In each iteration, the node with the lowest priority (i.e., the lowest estimated cost from the start node to the goal node) is removed from the frontier.\n",
    "6. If the current node is the goal node, the algorithm terminates and the function returns the path from the start node to the goal node by tracing back through the came_from dictionary.\n",
    "7. Otherwise, for each neighbor of the current node, the algorithm calculates the cost of reaching the neighbor from the start node and the estimated cost from the neighbor to the goal node using the heuristic function.\n",
    "8. If the neighbor has not been visited yet or the newly calculated cost is less than the previously calculated cost, the neighbor is added to the frontier queue with its new priority and the came_from and cost_so_far dictionaries are updated with the current node and new cost.\n",
    "9. After visiting all neighbors of the current node, the algorithm goes back to step 5.\n",
    "10. If no path is found to the goal node, the function returns None.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $\\color{green}{\\text{weighted_astar()}}$\n",
    "This is a weighted A* algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, taking into account the cost of edges between nodes. Here is a breakdown of the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "* graph is a dictionary representation of the graph, where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes.\n",
    "* start is the starting node in the graph.\n",
    "* goal is the goal node that we want to reach.\n",
    "* heuristic is a function that estimates the distance between a node and the goal node.\n",
    "* weight is a parameter that represents the weight of each edge in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function begins by computing the weight of each edge in the graph and initializing the data structures. The edge_weights dictionary stores the weight of each edge between two nodes, while the open_set list contains nodes that are being considered for expansion, and the closed_set set contains nodes that have already been visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The g_score dictionary stores the cost of the shortest known path to a node, while the f_score dictionary stores the estimated total cost of the path through a node to the goal. The came_from dictionary stores the previous node in the path to each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function then enters a loop where it continues to expand nodes until the goal is reached or there are no more nodes to expand. In each iteration of the loop, the node with the lowest f_score in the open_set is selected for expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each neighboring node of the current node, the function computes the tentative g_score, which is the cost of the current path plus the weight of the edge connecting the current node to the neighbor. If the tentative g_score is lower than the current g_score of the neighbor, the neighbor is updated with the new g_score and the f_score is updated accordingly. The neighbor is then added to the open_set with a priority based on its f_score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the goal is reached, the function backtracks through the came_from dictionary to reconstruct the path from the start to the goal node. The function then returns the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "If no path is found, the function returns None.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the weight of each edge in the graph using the weight input.\n",
    "2. Initialize the data structures:\n",
    "* open_set: a priority queue that stores the nodes to be explored, where each node is a tuple of the node's f-score and its id.\n",
    "* closed_set: a set that stores the nodes that have been explored.\n",
    "* g_score: a dictionary that stores the cost of the shortest path from the start node to each node.\n",
    "* f_score: a dictionary that stores the estimated total cost from the start node to the goal node passing through each node.\n",
    "* came_from: a dictionary that stores the parent node of each explored node in the shortest path.\n",
    "3. Add the start node to the open_set with a priority of its f-score.\n",
    "4. While the open_set is not empty, get the node with the lowest f-score from the open_set.\n",
    "5. If the current node is the goal node, reconstruct and return the shortest path.\n",
    "6. Add the current node to the closed_set.\n",
    "7. For each neighbor of the current node, compute the tentative g-score by adding the edge weight to the g-score of the current node.\n",
    "8. If the tentative g-score is better than the g-score of the neighbor, update the neighbor's g-score and f-score, and add the neighbor to the open_set with a priority of its f-score.\n",
    "9. Repeat steps 4-8 until the goal node is found or the open_set is empty.\n",
    "10. If the goal node is not found, return None.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $\\color{green}{\\text{heuristic()}}$\n",
    "This function calculates the heuristic value for the A* algorithm to estimate the cost of the cheapest path from a given node to the goal node. The heuristic function takes three parameters: the graph, a node, and the goal node. The breakdown of the function is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function first computes the number of nodes in the graph.\n",
    "2. It then calculates the size of the grid based on the number of nodes in the graph. The size of the grid is computed by taking the square root of the number of nodes and adding 1 to it.\n",
    "3. The function then initializes the x and y coordinates of the nodes in the graph. It creates a dictionary called coords that maps each node to its (x, y) coordinates on the grid.\n",
    "4. The function converts the given node and goal node to strings to use them as keys to access their coordinates in the coords dictionary.\n",
    "Finally, the function computes the Euclidean distance between the coordinates of the given node and the goal node using the distance formula. This distance serves as the heuristic value for the given node.\n"
