            <h1>GitHub Repository for AI Course Projects</h1>
            <p>This repository contains the code for the computer assignments of the Artificial Intelligence course at
                the University of Tehran, taught by Dr. Fadaei.</p>
            <h2>Computer Assignment 0: Data Analysis for Income Estimation</h2>
            <p>This project is an implementation of various data manipulation techniques using the pandas library in
                Python. The code performs data cleaning, data filtering, and data visualization. It also implements data
                normalization and Gaussian curve plotting. The dataset used is related to income estimation based on
                various demographic features.</p>
            <h2>Computer Assignment 1: Pathfinding Algorithms for Delivering Pizza</h2>
            <p>This project contains various search algorithms, such as Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, and
                A*. The algorithms are used to find the shortest path between the delivery person and a customer's
                location. The project also implements the Iterative Deepening Search algorithm for pathfinding.</p>
            <h2>Computer Assignment 2: Genetic Algorithms in Stock Market and Minmax Game in Othello</h2>
            <p>This project contains two parts. The first part focuses on using a genetic algorithm approach to optimize
                the allocation of capital among various assets in the stock market. The second part implements the
                Minimax algorithm to create an AI player for the Othello game.</p>
            <h3>Part 1: Genetic Algorithm for Stock Market Investment</h3>
            <p>This project aims to maximize the return and minimize the risk in the stock market. It uses a genetic
                algorithm approach to optimize the coefficients that represent the proportion of the capital invested in
                each asset. These coefficients are restricted to sum up to 1, meaning that the capital is fully
                invested.</p>
            <h3>Part 2: Minimax Game in Othello</h3>
            <p>This project implements the Minimax algorithm to create an AI player for the Othello game. The algorithm
                searches through the game tree and selects the move that maximizes the AI's chances of winning, assuming
                the opponent will also play optimally. The project also implements alpha-beta pruning to improve the
                algorithm's efficiency.</p>
            <h2>Computer Assignment 3: Gaussian Naive Bayes and Bernoulli Naive Bayes on Image Classification of Iranian
                Digits</h2>
            <p>This project focuses on implementing Gaussian Naive Bayes and Bernoulli Naive Bayes algorithms for image
                classification of Iranian digits. The dataset used is related to handwritten digits, and the code
                preprocesses the data by applying various image processing techniques, such as thresholding and
                binarization. The project also visualizes the data and evaluates the performance of the algorithms using
                various metrics.</p>
